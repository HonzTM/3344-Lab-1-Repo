# 3344-Lab-1-Repo
Repository for Lab 1 of 3344

Description of Lab Activity: We were given an index file of HTML with errors. The aim of this lab was to find the errors, fix them, and commit each change to simulate reviewing a project and pushing those changes.
Mistakes in the original code: The header on line 8 was not closed properly. I fixed this by adding a / in the closing tag. Then, line 11 did not have a closing tag at all. I had to add one myself there. Third, the closing tags for html and body at the end of the code were in the wrong order, so I switched them around to fix it.
